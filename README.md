# GeoIP Functions for Apache Drill
This is a collection of GeoIP functions for Apache Drill. These functions are a wrapper for the MaxMind GeoIP Database.

IP Geo-Location is inherently imprecise and should never be relied on to get anything more than a general sense of where the traffic is coming from. 

* **`getCountryName( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the country name of the IP address, "Unknown" if the IP is unknown or invalid.
* **`getCountryConfidence( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the confidence score of the country ISO code of the IP address.
* **`getCountryISOCode( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the country ISO code of the IP address, "Unknown" if the IP is unknown or invalid.
* **`getCityName( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the city name of the IP address, "Unknown" if the IP is unknown or invalid.
* **`getCityConfidence( <ip> )`**:  This function returns confidence score of the city name of the IP address.
* **`getLatitudeFromIP( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the latitude associated with the IP address.
* **`getLongitudeFromIP( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the longitude associated with the IP address.
* **`getTimezoneFromIP( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the timezone associated with the IP address.
* **`getAccuracyRadius( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the accuracy radius associated with the IP address, 0 if unknown.
* **`getAverageIncome( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the average income of the region associated with the IP address, 0 if unknown.
* **`getMetroCode( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the metro code of the region associated with the IP address, 0 if unknown.
* **`getPopulationDensity( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the population density associated with the IP address.
* **`getPostalCode( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the postal code associated with the IP address.
* **`getCoordPoint( <ip> )`**:  This function returns a point for use in GIS functions of the lat/long of associated with the IP address.
* **`getASN( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the autonomous system of the IP address, "Unknown" if the IP is unknown or invalid.
* **`getASNOrganization( <ip> )`**:  This function returns the autonomous system organization of the IP address, "Unknown" if the IP is unknown or invalid.
* **`isEU( <ip> ), isEuropeanUnion( <ip> )`**:  This function returns `true` if the ip address is located in the European Union, `false` if not.
* **`isAnonymous( <ip> )`**:  This function returns `true` if the ip address is anonymous, `false` if not.

## Protocol Lookup Functions
These functions provide a convenience lookup capability for port numbers. They will accept port numbers as either an int or string.

* `get_service_name(<port number>, <protocol>)`:  This function returns the service name for a port and protocol combination.  
```
apache drill> select get_service_name(666, 'tcp') as service from (values(1));
+------------------+
|     service      |
+------------------+
| doom Id Software |
+------------------+
1 row selected (0.178 seconds)
```

* `get_short_service_name(<port number>, <protocol>)`: Same as above but returns a short protocol name. 

```
apache drill> select get_short_service_name(21, 'tcp') as service from (values(1));
   +---------+
   | service |
   +---------+
   | ftp     |
   +---------+
   1 row selected (0.112 seconds)
   ```
